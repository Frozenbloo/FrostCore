# FrostCore
A Fully Custom ServerCore for Spigot **1.19+**

I mainly started this project to enhance my java skills, so if you see any coding practices i should be doing, please say as I would greatly appreciate it.

If you want to see any features added, just open a [new issue](https://github.com/Frozenbloo/FrostCore/issues/new "Create a new Issue") with the enhancement tag and I will do my best to add it

###### "It is the life of the crystal, the architect of the flake, the fire of the frost, the soul of the sunbeam. This crisp winter air is full of it. All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost; the old that is strong does not wither, deep roots are not reached by the frost."
